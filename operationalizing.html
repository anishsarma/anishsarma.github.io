<h1>Operationalizing complexity</h1>
Often when we say a system is complex, we are not really naming a property of the system so much as naming the absence of a different property, simplicity. Complexity may be more than this absence; there may be commonalities, even universals, across complex systems. But a common notion of complexity would include many properties and exceptions, while the loss of simplicity can result from adding one property at a time. 
      <br><br>
So rather than defining complexity, we can develop a working definition of simplicity. I would say simplicity is a property of a system whereby, if we perturb some components or behaviors <i>X</i>, we know exactly or at least directionally what will happen to some components or behaviors <i>Y</i>. An interesting (and nontrivial) consequence of this definition is that a system can be simple in some descriptions and complex in others. Typing a letter onto paper using a typewriter and typing a letter into a web editor using a laptop are both simple in the map from keystroke to letter, but the laptop is complex in the map from laptop bits encoding a keystroke to server bits encoding a letter.
        <br><br>
      Defining complexity in opposition to this definition of simplicity saves us the trouble of asking whether any property is a property of all complex systems, or even if it is a universal property of the complex system we’re looking at right now. We just want to know whether the particular <i>X</i> to <i>Y</i> map we’re looking at is simple or not. If not, we want to know what properties are complex-ifying that map, and whether we have the mathematical tools to make it simple. 
      <br><br>
      This is a different kind of reductionism than reduction to components. It reduces complex systems as a class to a set of concrete properties at the boundaries of simple mathematical description. That list of potential properties is long but familiar: robustness, instability, autocatalysis, self-replication, spatial localization, decentralization, lossy communication, layering, mutation, evolution, learning, adaptation, and so on. We can embrace each of these without quite embracing idea that there is something special about complexity as a property all its own.
