<h1>Neuroscience-adjacent problems</h1>
Earlier in my career, I worked on optimization and control problems in a neuroscience context (mostly with the <a href='https://www.braingate.org/'>BrainGate</a> trial). Because neuroscience is so capacious and interdisciplinary, many of the problems that interest me remain neuroscience-adjacent. Iâ€™ve enjoyed collaborating with neuroscientists over the years, and I welcome continued collaboration related to the following problems:
<ul>
<li>What are the general properties of decentralized systems that sense, compute, decide, act, and learn? What are the most effective computational methods to describe and visualize such systems? How do we design inputs to such systems to elicit informative data or achieve desired clinical outcomes? </li>
<li>What can the general properties of the nervous system, an example of a system that learns, teach us about the immune system, another system that learns? </li>
<li>What are the cellular, metabolic, developmental, and immunological determinants of neuro-degenerative diseases? What about neuro-regenerative response to injury, ischemia, or hemorrhage?</li>
<li>What are the evolutionary, developmental, and physiological elements of direct cross-talk between the nervous system and the immune system? </li>
<li>What are practical ways to extend real-time bioelectrical sensing to other modalities of biochemical and cellular sensing?</li>
</ul>
