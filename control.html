<h1>What is control theory?</h1>
Control theory is the formal mathematical study of systems that respond to uncertain and dynamic environments. Such systems are called <I>control systems</I>. Likewise, control engineering is the practice of designing control systems. In biology and medicine (and neuroscience, and ecology), we might also think of <I>control science</i>, the practice of designing experiments and making inferences about natural or extant control systems. 
        Control science techniques are helpful when we confront complex systems that push the limitations of classical experimental design and statistical inference paradigms.
<br><br>
Relevant control systems in biology and medicine include homeostatic, immune, nervous, and developmental processes, as well as clinical decision-making processes, treatment protocols, and devices like pacemakers and ventilators. A theoretical foundation can guide the selection of mathematical models to describe biological systems; mathematical models can guide the selection of experiments and the design of clinical trials, which in turn guide the design of devices and therapies. My own past work has been used in each of these steps.
        The control framework spans theoretical, basic science, translational, applied, and clinical approaches. 
<br><br>
I am particularly interested in multicellular coordination, and relatedly in <I>multicellular coordination disorders</I>, a broad category that includes sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, neurodegenerative disease, epilepsy, and some cancers.
