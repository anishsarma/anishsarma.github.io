<h1>What is control?</h1>
        Control theory is the mathematical study of systems that respond to uncertain and dynamic environments. Control engineering is the practice of designing such systems, <b>control systems</b>, in applications like aerospace, electronics, and industrial-scale chemical synthesis. 
        <br><br>
        In biology and medicine (and in related domains like neuroscience and ecology), we might also think of <b>control systems science</b>, a set of emerging techniques for designing experiments and making inferences about natural or extant control systems. 
Control systems science is especially helpful when we encounter complex systems that are difficult to understand with classical experimental design and statistical inference paradigms. 
Developing control systems science has been a central goal of my research.
<br><br>
Control systems in biology and medicine include homeostatic, immune, nervous, and developmental processes, as well as clinical decision-making processes, treatment protocols, and devices like pacemakers and ventilators. The control framework therefore spans theoretical, basic science, translational, applied, and clinical approaches. A theoretical foundation can guide the selection of descriptive mathematical models, which can guide the selection of experiments and the design of clinical trials, which can guide the design of devices and therapies. 
This kind of reasoning can also run in the other direction: the fact that a treatment works can be an indispensable piece of evidence about the underlying biological control system.
<br><br>
I have been particularly interested in <b>multicellular coordination disorders</b>. Multicellular coordination is a special kind of control problem, and failures of multicellular coordination describe a diverse class of diseases with complex or unclear mechanisms, including sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, neurodegeneration, epilepsy, and some cancers.
