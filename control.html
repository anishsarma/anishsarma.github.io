<h1>What is control theory?</h1>
Control theory is the mathematical study of systems that respond to uncertain and dynamic environments. Such systems are called <I>control systems</I>. Predictably, control systems engineering is the practice of designing control systems. In biology and medicine (and neuroscience and ecology), we might also think of <I>control systems science</i>, a set of techniques for designing experiments and making inferences about natural or extant control systems. 
Control systems science is especially helpful when we confront complex systems that are difficult to interrogate with classical experimental design and statistical inference paradigms. 
<br><br>
Developing foundations and techniques in control systems science has been the major emphasis of my work in recent years.
<br><br>
Relevant control systems in biology and medicine include homeostatic, immune, nervous, and developmental processes, as well as clinical decision-making processes, treatment protocols, and devices like pacemakers and ventilators. The control framework therefore spans theoretical, basic science, translational, applied, and clinical approaches. A theoretical foundation can guide the selection of descriptive mathematical models, which can guide the selection of experiments and the design of clinical trials, which in turn can guide the design of devices and therapies. My own past work has been used at each of these steps.
        
<br><br>
I am particularly interested in multicellular coordination, and relatedly <I>multicellular coordination disorders</I>, a broad category that includes sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, neurodegenerative disease, epilepsy, and some cancers.
