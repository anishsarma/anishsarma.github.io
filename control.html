<h1>What is control theory?</h1>
Control theory is the formal mathematical study of systems that respond to uncertain and dynamic environments, which we call <I>control systems</I>. Likewise, control engineering is the practice of designing control systems. In biology and medicine (as well as neuroscience and ecology), we might also think of <I>control science</i>, the practice of designing experiments and making inferences about natural or extant control systems. 
<br><br>
Control systems in biology and medicine include homeostatic, immune, nervous, and developmental processes â€” as well as clinical decision-making processes and medical devices like pacemakers and ventilators. Often a mathematical theory of control systems in general guides the selection of particular mathematical models, which guides the selection of experiments, which guides the design of devices and therapies. A control framework therefore spans theoretical, basic science, translational, applied, and clinical approaches. 
<br><br>
I have been particularly interested in control enacted by multicellular coordination<, which go hand-in-hand with <I>multicellular coordination disorders</I>. This is a capacious category that includes neurodegenerative disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, and some cancers.
